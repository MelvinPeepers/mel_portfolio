              I'm currently a support engineer at Callcentric, which is a BYOD
              (Bring Your Own Device) Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
              provider. I provide support for onboarding new customers, billing,
              product questions, debugging Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),
              helping individuals and companies around the world configure and
              manage their IP PBXes and hardware devices, troubleshooting issues
              with devices and networks. I also work with developers testing new
              user agents and SIP apps as well as creating guides for them.
            </p>

              Before Callcentric, I worked at Pace Analytical as a contract
              employee for 3M in Minnesota. I helped the 3M Environmental Lab
              create an archiving process for all their environmental lab
              reports. I also maintained and documented the archiving process

              I enjoy working with customers. Listening to their problems and
              finding solutions to those problems. After learning software
              development I've discovered new ways I can help customers by
              improving existing products, adding new features, fixing bugs, and
              creating new products.

              creating new products. For the past 16 months, I've been a student
              at Lambda School, studying Full Stack Web Development. In that
              time, I've learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js,
              Express.js, and Python. With these tools, I have created websites
              and apps in both solo and team environments. I've also planned
              from the ground up several apps.
