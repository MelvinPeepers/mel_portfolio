              I'm currently a support engineer at Callcentric, which is a BYOD
              (Bring Your Own Device) Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
              provider. I provide support for onboarding new customers, billing
              and product questions, and debugging Session Initiation Protocol
              (SIP). I assist individuals and companies around the world in
              configuring, managing, and troubleshooting issues with devices and
              networks. I also work with developers on testing new user agents
              and SIP apps as well as creating guides for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before Callcentric, I worked at Pace Analytical as a contract
              employee for 3M in Minnesota. I helped the 3M Environmental Lab
              create an archiving process for all their environmental lab
              reports. I also maintained and documented the archiving process.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy working with customers, listening to their problems, and
              finding solutions to those problems. After learning software
              development, I've discovered new ways I can help customers by
              improving existing products, adding new features, fixing bugs, and
              creating new products. For the past 16 months, I've been a student
              at Lambda School, studying Full Stack Web Development. In that
              time, I've learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js,
              Express.js, and Python. With these tools, I have created websites
              and apps in both solo and team environments. I've also planned
              several websites and apps from the ground up.
